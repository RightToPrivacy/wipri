# wipri (WiFi Privacy)
### WIFi MAC Device Disinfo: Address Changer/Hostname randomizer/Device/Signal/location Privacy (derived from my previous maccleaner concept)
#

# Run wipri command anytime you need privacy or (optionally) add it to cron or systemd. 
# install.sh only installs at boot if you answer 'yes' for the question to do so
# otherwise install.sh only installs wipri as a command you can use anytime (as root/sudo)


### Simple Setup/Installation for new wipri command on Linux:
sudo bash install.sh
 
 That's it. Now wipri is installed as a command for anytime you need privacy of hostname or mac address or signal. Or all three at the same time.

USE:
wipri -d [device] -r [randomizes mac continually changing times/addresses] -a [continually randomize MAC, hostname, signal variations] -m [Static MAC] -i [new MAC identity] -h [rand hostname] -H [restore prev hostname] -s [random signals]

# Use any number of flags of your choice.
